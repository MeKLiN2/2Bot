An HTTP api for detecting faces in images. The server will receive an image and pass it along to OpenCV. Face detection will be done and the result returned as JSON. The JSON contains information about the face location (the rectangular area) and a url of the image marked up with detection info.

Features such as gender, age and mood will be attempted.

[05:22:49:AM] MeKLiN: without messing with the tc server
[05:23:03:AM] MeKLiN: it would really need to use the web browser
[05:23:14:AM] MeKLiN: i could just ask a good coder how to chart the project

[05:25:13:AM] max_contrast: i think we'd need to either have a short recording of chatter faces from different angles or use something like reface to get the gist of what they look like and then add code to the bot to only allow people to cam based on the facial recognition of that

[07:27:30:AM] Advantageous_M: sticks sometime4s
[07:27:33:AM] max_contrast: if you made eachother sincerely happy in your shoes i'd do my best to make it work despite her flaws
[07:27:49:AM] max_contrast: but if you didn't have that connection and you feel like it was toxic it's best to let go

At the mere touch of cold philosophy?
There was an awful rainbow once in heaven:
We know her woof, her texture; she is given
In the dull catalogue of common things.
Philosophy will clip an Angel's wings,
Conquer all mysteries by rule and line,
Empty the haunted air, and gnomed mine—
Unweave a rainbow, as it erewhile made
The tender-person'd Lamia melt into a shade.

[06:10:46:PM] Wittmann: yeah that
[06:11:00:PM] MeKLiN: to get it easy working i think sudo apt-get update
[06:11:03:PM] MeKLiN: and obs will update
[06:11:14:PM] MeKLiN: i also know tricks to make wine shrotcuts for windows apps
[06:11:20:PM] MeKLiN: it will be easier and faste rthan windows
[06:11:32:PM] MeKLiN: u can just type sudo apt install winetricks

[06:11:46:PM] MeKLiN: well, sudo winetricks NameOfThing
[06:11:52:PM] MeKLiN: there are a bunch of games i think it will download

[06:12:12:PM] MeKLiN: i dont use it for winamp, i do it manually thru WINE regular sudo wine
[06:12:20:PM] MeKLiN: then you type Winecfg and it opens 'windows settings'
[06:12:26:PM] MeKLiN: i have good tutorial page u can see later
[06:12:38:PM] MeKLiN: but Winetricks Winamp would install it easily
[06:12:56:PM] MeKLiN: then you have to chmod and do a wineprefix path
[06:13:05:PM] MeKLiN: 2 small commands and then typing 'AppName' in termainal opens it
[06:13:12:PM] Wittmann: obs will get the virtual cam automatically

[06:13:18:PM] MeKLiN: making a wine shortcut to the desktop to just double click it is my next step

[06:13:31:PM] MeKLiN: but im gonna send you my Bash history
[06:13:40:PM] MeKLiN: just look at the stuff i did to get obs on my own
[06:13:47:PM] MeKLiN: then you will have unfailing virtual cam
[06:13:49:PM] MeKLiN: no errors ever
[06:13:56:PM] Wittmann: sounds good
[06:14:12:PM] MeKLiN: see

[06:36:52:PM] Wittmann: lol
[06:36:56:PM] MeKLiN: all games are cpu based now, and that is the best gpu u need i think
[06:37:09:PM] MeKLiN: rust on gtx3080 vs 1080 is same
[06:37:19:PM] MeKLiN: i get same framerate or beter than those guys they say they get 60 50
[06:37:24:PM] MeKLiN: on $800 gpus
[06:37:33:PM] MeKLiN: because its a joke, the gpu doesnt process anything
[06:37:37:PM] Wittmann: cpu more impotant the lower the resolution
[06:37:51:PM] MeKLiN: just the way the game runs it drans the cpu
[06:37:52:PM] illuminatimember:965876 Left the room.
[06:37:52:PM] Wittmann: more frames = more cpu
[06:37:53:PM] MeKLiN: drains*
[06:38:07:PM] MeKLiN: u can see overclockers doing it to achieve friames, not mess with gpu
[06:38:23:PM] MeKLiN: i get 300fps in dota because windows doesnt touch my cpu ever
[06:38:23:PM] Wittmann: underclocking gpu is common now
[06:38:37:PM] MeKLiN: yeah there are warnings not to run past 1200hz on my rx570
[06:39:08:PM] MeKLiN: if u look at ur paste under ur gpu it burns up really fast
[06:39:13:PM] MeKLiN: faster than the cpu's
[06:39:22:PM] MeKLiN: its a weak chip and needs to be cold to do anything
[06:39:31:PM] MeKLiN: this is why they warn u not to exceed 1200hz
[06:39:44:PM] Wittmann: i thought about doing a loop but my temps are good as is
[06:39:52:PM] MeKLiN: i have changed my paste like 8 times since 2017
[06:39:59:PM] MeKLiN: thats when i broke my gtx1060...
[06:40:15:PM] MeKLiN: yeah a corsair would be nice but id put it on my cpu
[06:40:18:PM] Wittmann: I do paste once a year
[06:40:34:PM] MeKLiN: my 3600x 6core12thread does 1.44v
[06:40:56:PM] MeKLiN: most people try to undervolt it and keep it at its regular 3800mhz or 4000mhz is an oc
[06:41:01:PM] MeKLiN: and take off all the boost stuff
[06:41:15:PM] MeKLiN: it crashes games i think windows has to have the right power profile

[06:43:00:PM] MeKLiN: it boosts the clock to above 3.8 its stock on desktop
[06:43:12:PM] MeKLiN: maybe thats why i crashed in the dota menu tho
[06:44:00:PM] MeKLiN: that chip is just an OC version of my 35600x
[06:44:10:PM] MeKLiN: probably will die in 3 years
[06:44:36:PM] MeKLiN: meanwhile mine is being babied at a mere 350fps max_fps in console in dota, and other 2013 era games like rust
[06:44:44:PM] Wittmann: yeah i dont oc until the chip is older normally
[06:44:53:PM] MeKLiN: i run around in rust looking at the ground to keep my cpu ready to overheat and give me max fps

[11:58:46:PM] CAF: Even Jesus didn’t do shit before 30. There’s a reason “life begins at 30” is a thing. It takes until 25 for your brain to finish developing, and until 30 to kick all the ego and self-importance and idealism and hope out of you. Then you can play properly. 0-30 is the tutorial and whatever anyone does in that period is just from coincidences of birth.
